# Horizon Students API

This repository contains the code for the Horizon Students API, a simple RESTful API designed to manage student information. The API provides endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database table named `horizonstudents`. Below, you'll find information on how to use and configure the API.

## Online Testing

I have deployed this API online, and you can test it using ðŸ‘‰ [this link](https://soc-achinthas-projects.vercel.app/restful/horizonstudents)ðŸ‘ˆ. You can use Postman or any API testing tool to interact with the API.

## Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-achintha/restful-api-demo.git
   cd restful-api-demo
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `config` directory and set the following environment variables:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Run the API:**
   Start a local development server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
